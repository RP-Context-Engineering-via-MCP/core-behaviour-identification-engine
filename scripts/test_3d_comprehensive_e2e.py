"""
Comprehensive E2E Benchmark: 3D Hybrid Retrieval + Co-Occurrence Graph
========================================================================

Covers 10 behavior categories:
  Food & Diet, Exercise & Fitness, Sleep & Routine, Work & Productivity,
  Entertainment, Travel & Transport, Music, Social, Shopping & Health,
  Reading & Pets & Technology

Phase 1 — SEED:      15 diverse prompts via /extract (v1, synchronous storage)
                      CO_PROMPT graph edges are created per prompt.
Phase 2 — RETRIEVE:  25 prompt-only tests via /v2/extract
Phase 3 — HISTORY:   25 prompt + history tests via /v2/extract

Both Phase 2 and 3 validate:
  - related_behaviors  (from embedding / LRA search)
  - associated_behaviors (from 1-hop graph expansion)

Each run uses a unique user_id to avoid interference with previous runs.
All actions within a run share the same session_id.

Results saved to: docs/behavior retrieval testing/YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM_testN.txt

Run:
    python -m tests.test_3d_comprehensive_e2e

Prerequisites:
    - Server running on http://localhost:6009
    - Database migrated with search_vector column + GIN index
    - Database migrated with behavior_co_occurrences table
